## 关于我

我是黄曦。目前供职于[深圳市人工智能与机器人研究院（AIRS）](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn)，于群体智能研究中心任助理研究员，同时也是香港中文大学（深圳）[网络通信与经济实验室](https://ncel.cuhk.edu.cn)（Network Communications and Economics Lab, NCEL）的成员。目前主要关注智能网络系统优化与设计，多智能体交互，以及人工智能与经济学领域交叉问题。具体工作详见[我的谷歌学术主页](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_BRMr6cAAAAJ)。

在此之前，我从上海科技大学获得通信与信息系统专业博士学位，从南京大学软件工程专业获得学士学位。读博期间（2017年）我还曾前往加州大学伯克利分校进行访学。

## About Me

I'm Xi Huang, currently working as an assistant research scientist with [Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS)](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn), and a member of [Network Communications and Economics Lab](https://ncel.cuhk.edu.cn) at CUHK, Shenzhen. My research interests include the optimization for intelligent network systems, interactions among multiple agents, and the economic scope between AI and society. Here's the [link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_BRMr6cAAAAJ) to my homepage on Google Scholar.  

Before being part of AIRS, I spent my graduate school life at ShanghaiTech University, China, during which I went to Berkeley as a visiting student in 2017 and after which received my Ph.D. from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor degree from Nanjing University, China, majoring in Software Engineering.
