## 关于我

我是黄曦。目前供职于[深圳市人工智能与机器人研究院（AIRS）](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn)，同时也是香港中文大学（深圳）[网络通信与经济实验室](https://ncel.cuhk.edu.cn)（Network Communications and Economics Lab, NCEL）的成员。主要关注大型网络系统的围绕多智能体的优化、决策与交互。具体见[我的谷歌学术主页](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_BRMr6cAAAAJ)。

此前，我从上海科技大学获得博士学位（导师为[邵子瑜教授](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/shaozy/home.html)），从南京大学软件工程专业获得学士学位，读博期间曾前往加州大学伯克利分校访学。

这里记录我的个人思考，不定期更新。内容原创，转载请注明出处，或与我联系（邮箱：dr.huangxi@gmail.com）。欢迎任何有意义的交流！

## About Me
- I'm Xi, a research scientist with Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS), China. I'm interested in multi-agent interactions and decision-making in networked systems, hopefully bridge the gap between AI and our society. Here is the [link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_BRMr6cAAAAJ) to my homepage on Google Scholar. 
- Before being a part of AIRS, I spent my graduate school life at ShanghaiTech University and The University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. During that time, I visited UC Berkeley in 2017. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor degree from Nanjing University, China, majoring in Software Engineering.

- Feel free to discuss any questions about multi-agent interactions or decision-making via e-mail: dr dot huangxi at gmail dot com. Enjoy your stay here!
