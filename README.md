## About me
- I'm Xi, a research scientist with Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS), China. I'm interested in multi-agent interactions and decision-making in networked systems, hopefully bridge the gap between AI and our society. Here is the [link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_BRMr6cAAAAJ) to my Google Scholar.  
- Before being a part of AIRS, I spent my graduate school life at ShanghaiTech University and The University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. During that time, I visited UC Berkeley in 2017. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor degree from Nanjing University, China, majoring in Software Engineering. 
- This is a personal website where I'll present part of my thoughts on things in daily life. Otherwise stated, the content presented on this site is all my original work. All rights reserved.
