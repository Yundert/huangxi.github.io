## About me
- I'm currently with Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS), working as an assistant research scientist. My research interests include interactions that involve multiple agents and the economic scope between AI and our society. Before being part of AIRS, I spent my graduate school life at ShanghaiTech University, China, during which I went to Berkeley as a visiting student in 2017 and after which received my Ph.D. from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor degree from Nanjing University, China, majoring in Software Engineering.
